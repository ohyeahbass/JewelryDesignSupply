		<p '>My name is Morgan.  I am owner and metalsmith at The Copper Paisley Studio, formerly MetalAdornments.  I create handmade artsian jewelry.  I currently live in South Jordan, Utah with my husband and our two furry children.</p>
		<p >Ten years ago, I was going to community college and working as a customer service store manager.  Trying to balancing health issues, stress and everyday demands.  I was swept off my feet, when I met my husband in '06. Having the space, support and time, I found a creative outlet for my stress.</p>
		<p >I started out on Etsy, selling beaded jewelry and selling my work at local salons and boutiques on the side.  My little business had grown so much, in such a short time.  I needed a break from high demands of work and finding a balance for my creative outlet.  At which point, I couldn't balance the both worlds anymore. I never saw myself as someone who was interested in jewelry making as a career, but with my customer service experience and some real dedication to what I saw growing, I found a journey and it has been interesting to say the least. So with uncertianity, and the support of my husband I decided to take my jewelry full time, in hopes that I could become an aspiring metalsmith and bench jeweler. In 2012 I was nominated as accessory designer of the year for Salt Lake City, Utah.  The RawArtist exerpience really gets you out there. I had the opportunity to pair some of my designs with up and coming designers for hair, makeup and clothing designers during two fashion shows and a photoshoot for a magazine.</p>
